Accessibility Anaylsis:
1. What corrections did you have to make?
There were a lot of empty buttons that didn't have any text that the WAVE
Extension could read. To fix this I went back to add a description of what
each button did with the aria-label command.

There were a few contrast errors. I darkened the colors in those instances
to increase the contrast.

There were also no page regions, to fix it I added a <main> and <aside> tag

There was also a missing h1 header. To fix it I switched the h2 header to an h1 header.

There were also missing form label errors on the accessibility sites but 
adding aria-labels similarly to the empty buttons seemed to fix the issues.

2. I was able to fix all the accessibility errors alerts my photo app ran into.

As for whether or not I think all accessibility problems are solvable, I think
there are probably a few that cannot be as of now. One example is aspects that are
dependent on the users--for example, in many photo apps like Instagram adding
alternative text is not only hard to find, but is also dependent on the user
posting the picture to add that text. While we as designers can make the option
more visible (and should), I'm not sure what can be done to make sure users add in the
alternative text (maybe making it required to do so or automating it, but I 
don't think either is particularly plausible right now or a good idea).

3. I think without the CSS the app is still "usable", all (or most) of the
important aspects are fully tabbable and we have aria-labels that describe
all the buttons functions. However, I do think without the CSS the balancing
of the site gets really messy and can be hard to visually navigate.

4. As it is now, I don't think my site is usable with images off. While 
everything is still tabbable and labeled, some of the labels are not descriptive
or indicative of what the image is (most of what I have right now) is just
"Profile Picture for [User]", which doesn't tell us anything.
